## Markdown

**Markdown is a `lightweight markup language` that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.**

**How does Markup work?**

> When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point the document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed.
